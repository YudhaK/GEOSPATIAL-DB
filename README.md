# GEOSPATIAL-DB
# Introduction
This is my project about how geospatial data can read to android google map app. If you have .shp geospatial data you have to convert it to .KML geospatial data that contain Latitude and Longtitude that support for android google map app. I am using global mapper for converting the geospatial data.
# This code is just the web database
